Welcome to the <b>NanoDoge</b> Referral Giveaway!

You can use the bottom 3 buttons to generate your shill messages! Please make sure that you copy the whole message, including the image. Your referral link is in the body of the text, so you must copy the whole message.

You can check to see how many people you've referred by clicking on the <b>📋Dashboard</b> button.
If you'd like to see the top contestants, you can click on the <b>🔝Leaderboard</b> button.

If you refer someone but they leave the group, you will lose the point you had earned. You must refer people and ensure that they stay in this group to retain your referral point.

Exploits can be identified and will result in disqualification, so please do not attempt to exploit the referral system. 

Contestants with the most referrals will win whitelist spots, so start shilling! 

Have fun & good luck!
<i>The NanoDoge Team</i>
